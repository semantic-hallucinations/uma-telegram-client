Here are some notes to decompose plenty old troubles

### Todo

- [ ] Implement inserting '@'-symbol in bot-username. Check if bot-name string contains it or not.
- [ ] Refactor logging messages in methods. Try proxy/decorator implementation
- [ ] Troubleshoot md-formatting
- [ ] Refactor filters and handlers code-style if neccessary
- [ ] Incapsulate entrypoint at main.py (optional)
